The water is the cleanest in the world and the bagels taste delicious. In New York City, residents do not need Brita filters because the water is just superb.</p>

<p> According to the NYC Department of Environmental Protection, “New York City drinking water is world-renowned for its quality.” Water flows from upstate reservoirs in Putnam and Westchester counties and the Catskills to serve nine million customers throughout New York state, amounting to roughly 1 billion gallons of fresh water each day. </p>

<p> Then why are New Yorkers complaining about it? Based on a collection of 311 complaints from this past year, concerned residents have been telling the city that they are not happy with their water. Most particularly, Brooklynites. </p>

<p>We were unable to reach an expert to comment on why Queens residents are not complaining as much as those in Brooklyn. </p>

<p> The overall problem seems not to lie with industrial contamination that usually afflicts underground water sources but from the dilapidated pipes.</p>

<p> “Lead is the most common reason that you run into a water problem in New York,” says Dr. Wilkenfeld, director of the Division of Occupational and Environmental Medicine at Winthrop University Hospital in Mineola.</p>

<p> For now, it seems like New Yorkers will have to check their pipes before making their morning tea.</p>
